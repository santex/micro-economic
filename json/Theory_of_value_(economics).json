{"cursor":"1936","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\"'Theory of value'\" is a generic term which encompasses all the theories within\neconomics that attempt to explain the exchange value or price of goods and\nservices. Key questions in economic theory include why goods and services are\npriced as they are, how the value of goods and services comes about, and for\nnormative value theories how to calculate the correct price of goods and\nservices (if such a value exists). Theories of value fall into two main\ncategories:\n\n'Intrinsic (objective) theories'\n::''see main article: Intrinsic theory of value\n:Intrinsic theories, as the name implies, hold that the price of goods and\nservices is not a function of subjective judgements. 'Subjective theories'\n::''see main article: Subjective theory of value\n:Subjective theories hold that for an object to have economic value (a non-zero\nprice), the object must be useful in satisfying human wants and it must be in\nlimited supply. This is the foundation of the marginalist theory of value. In\nthe context of explaining price, the marginal utility theory is not a normative\ntheory of value.\n\nIn either case what are being addressed are general prices, i.e. prices in the\naggregate, not a specific price of a specific good or service in a given\ncircumstance. Theories in either class allow for deviations when a particular\nprice is struck in a real-world market transactions, or when a price is set in\nsome price fixing regime.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Theory_of_value_(economics)","recorded":1362560498,"links":19,"instances":["economics","economics","economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Value theory|","Economic theories"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/ThreeCoins.svg/43px-ThreeCoins.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["good","economics"],["service","economics"],["value","economics"]],"members":["good","value","service"],"related":["Economics","Exchange_value","Price","Good_(economics)","Service_(economics)","Intrinsic_theory_of_value","Subjective_theory_of_value","Marginalism","Marginal_utility","Cost-of-production_theory_of_value","Utility_theory_of_value","Labor_theory_of_value","Power_theory_of_value","Marginalism","Paradox_of_value","Value_(economics)"]}
