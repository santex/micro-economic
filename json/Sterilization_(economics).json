Paul Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld, \"International Economics, Theory and\nPolicy\", Addison Wesley, 2003, 6th Edition, pgs. 488â489 The opposite is\nunsterilized intervention, where monetary authorities have not insulated their\ncountry's domestic money supply and internal balance against foreign exchange\nintervention.\n\nSterilization is most often used in the context of a central bank that takes\nactions to negate potentially harmful impacts of capital inflows â such as\ncurrency appreciation and inflation â both of which can reduce export\ncompetitiveness. More generally, it may refer to any form of monetary policy\nwhich seeks to hold the domestic money supply unchanged despite external shocks\nor other changes, including the flow of capital out of the relevant area\n(generally, a country).\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, sterilization was sometimes associated\nwith efforts by monetary authorities to \"defend\" the value of their currency. In\nthe 1930s and in the 21st century, sterilisation has most commonly been\nassociated with efforts by nations with a balance of payments surplus to prevent\ncurrency appreciation.\n","linknr":168,"url":"Sterilization_(economics)","recorded":1362671492,"links":23,"instances":["currency"],"pdf":["http://faculty.washington.edu/karyiu/papers/crisis-sur.pdf","http://faculty.washington.edu/karyiu/papers/crisis-sur.pdf","http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp73.pdf","http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp73.pdf"],"categories":["Macroeconomics and monetary economics","International economics"],"headings":["Examples","Notes and references"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Marriner_S._Eccles_Federal_Reserve_Board_Building.jpg/350px-Marriner_S._Eccles_Federal_Reserve_Board_Building.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["depreciation","currency"]],"members":["depreciation"],"related":["Great_Depression","Macroeconomics","Central_bank","Money_supply","Balance_of_payments","Open_market_operations","Capital_account","Floating_exchange_rate","Inflation","Monetary_policy","Depreciation_(currency)","Forex","Foreign_exchange_reserves","Current_account","Speculative_attack","Carry_trade","Michael_C._Burda","Oxford_University_Press","University_of_Washington","ECB","Financial_crisis_of_2007–2010","The_Financial_Times","Reserve_requirement","The_Financial_Times","China_Daily","Currency_war","The_Financial_Times","Gold_standard","Bloomberg_L.P."]}
