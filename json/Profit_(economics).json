'Normal profit' represents the total opportunity costs (both\nexplicit and implicit) of a venture to an investor, whereas 'economic profit'\n(also 'abnormal', 'pure', 'supernormal', or 'excess profit', as the case may be\n'[[monopoly profit]]' or 'oligopoly profit') is the difference between a firm's\ntotal revenue and all costs (including normal profit). Carbaugh, 2006. p.84. A related concept, sometimes\nconsidered synonymous to profit in certain contexts, is that of economic rent.\n\nIn Classical economics and Marxian economics, profit is the return to an owner\nof capital stock (means of production or land) in any productive pursuit\ninvolving labor, or a return on bonds and money invested in capital markets. [http://www.economictheories.org/2008/07/adam-smith-wage-profit-\nrent-theory.html Adam Smith Profit] \"In general, the classical economists made\nno serious attempts to explain the nature and source of profits until the\n1820s, when they responded to socialist criticism of profit. Smith apparently\naccepted without question the legitimacy of profits as a payment to the\ncapitalist for performing a socially useful function, namely, to provide labor\nwith the necessities of life and with materials and machinery with which to\nwork during the time-consuming production process.\" By extension, in\nMarxian economic theory, the maximization of profit corresponds to the\naccumulation of capital, which is the driving force behind economic activity\nwithin capitalist economic systems.\n\nOther types of profit have been referenced, including social profit (related to\nexternalities). It is not to be confused with profit in finance and accounting,\nwhich is equal to revenue minus only explicit costs, and\nsuperprofit, a concept in Marxian economic theory.\n\nProfit is not synonymous with the concepts of profitability and the\nprofit motive.\n","linknr":371,"url":"Profit_(economics)","recorded":1362584784,"links":64,"instances":["economics","accounting","economics"],"pdf":["http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f200400/200457.pdf"],"categories":["Profit|","Microeconomics","Economics terminology"],"headings":["Normal profit","Other applications of the term","Maximization","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg/200px-GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Perfect_competition_in_the_short_run_%28simple%29.svg/220px-Perfect_competition_in_the_short_run_%28simple%29.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Imperfect_competition_in_the_short_run.svg/220px-Imperfect_competition_in_the_short_run.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Imperfect_competition_after_regulation.svg/220px-Imperfect_competition_after_regulation.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["profit","accounting"],["demand","economics"],["profit","accounting"],["value","economics"]],"members":["value","profit","demand"],"related":["Microeconomic","Opportunity_cost","Explicit_cost","Implicit_cost","Firm","Revenue","Economic_rent","Classical_economics","Marxian_economics","Owner","Capital_stock","Means_of_production","Accumulation_of_capital","Economic_system","Externality","Profit_(accounting)","Superprofit","Marx","Profit_motive","Factor_of_production","Risk-return_spectrum","Perfect_competition","Economic_equilibrium","Perfect_competition","Long_run","Barriers_to_entry","Monopolistic_competition","Contestable_market","Monopoly","Oligopoly","Demand_(economics)","Barrier_to_entry","Steve_Keen","Profit_maximization","Competition_law","Predatory_pricing","Microsoft_Corporation","Natural_monopoly","United_States_v._AT&T","Externalities","Consumer_surplus","Interdependence","Game_theory","Economic_surplus","Economic_rent","Economic_value_added","Externality","Inverse_demand_function","Profit_(accounting)","Profit_efficiency","Profit_motive","Profitability_index","Rate_of_profit","Superprofit","Surplus_value","Tendency_of_the_rate_of_profit_to_fall","Value_(economics)","Murray_Rothbard"]}
