{"cursor":"8195","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In economics and finance, an 'index' is a statistical measure of changes in a\nrepresentative group of individual data points. These data may be derived from\nany number of sources, including company performance, prices, productivity, and\nemployment. Economic indices (index, plural) track economic health from\ndifferent perspectives. Influential global financial indices such as the Global\nDow, and the NASDAQ Composite track the performance of selected large and\npowerful companies in order to evaluate and predict economic trends. The Dow\nJones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 primarily track U.S. markets, though\nsome legacy international companies are\nincluded. http://www.investopedia.com/university/indexes/index1.asp\nThe Consumer Price Index tracks the variation in prices for different consumer\ngoods and services over time in a constant geographical location, and is\nintegral to calculations used to adjust salaries, bond interest rates, and tax\nthresholds for inflation. The GDP Deflator Index, or real GDP, measures the\nlevel of prices of all new, domestically produced, final goods and services in\nan economy. http://www.politonomist.com/gdp-deflator-and-measuring-inflation-\n00491/ Market performance indices include the labour market index/job\nindex and proprietary stock market index investment instruments offered by\nbrokerage houses.\n\nSome indices display market variations that cannot be captured in other ways.\nFor example, the Economist provides a Big Mac Index that expresses the adjusted\ncost of a globally ubiquitous Big Mac as a percentage over or under the cost of\na Big Mac in the U.S. in USD (estimated: $3.57). http://www.oanda.com/currency/big-mac-\nindex The least relatively expensive Big Mac price occurs in Hong Kong, at\na 52% reduction from U.S. prices, or $1.71 U.S. Such indices can be used to help\nforecast currency values. From this example, it would be assumed that Hong Kong\ncurrency is undervalued, and provides a currency investment opportunity.\n","linknr":370,"url":"Index_(economics)","recorded":1362564794,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Business terms","Economic growth","Economic theories","Economics terminology","Econometrics","Index numbers|","Statistical terminology"],"headings":["Index numbers","Indices","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Economics","Finance","Global_Dow","NASDAQ_Composite","Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average","S&P_500","Price_Index","GDP_Deflator","Labour_market_index","Job_index","Stock_market_index","Brokerage_house","The_Economist","Big_Mac_Index","USD","Economic_data","Number","Price","Ratio","Commodity","Cost_of_living","Employment","Economics","Time_series","Purchasing_power_parity","Consumer_price_index","Retail_price","Cost-of-living_index","Inflation","Economic_history","Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average","S&P_500","S&P_400","S&P_600","S&P_1500","S&P/ASX_200","S&P/TSX_Composite_Index","S&P_Global_1200","S&P_Leveraged_Loan_Index","Caseâ€“Shiller_index","Russell_1000_Index","Russell_2000_Index","Russell_3000_Index","Russell_Midcap_Index","MSCI_World","MSCI_EAFE","BSE_Sensex","Reuters-CRB_Index","Asset-backed_securities_index","Credit_default_swap_index","ITraxx","Stock_market_index","Producer_price_index","Price_index","Chemical_plant_cost_indexes","Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics","Dow_Jones_Indexes","Indexation"]}
