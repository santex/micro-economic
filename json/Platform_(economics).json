Multi-Sided Platforms, Harvard Working Paper 12-\n024. Two-sided networks can be found in many industries, sharing the space\nwith traditional product and service offerings. Example markets include credit\ncards, composed of cardholders and merchants; HMOs (patients and doctors);\noperating systems (end-users and developers); night clubs (men seeking women,\nand often buying them drinks); yellow pages (advertisers and consumers); video\ngame consoles (gamers and game developers); recruitment sites (job seekers and\nrecruiters); search engines (advertisers and users); and communication networks,\nsuch as the Internet. Examples of the well known companies employing two sided\nmarkets include such organizations as American Express, eBay, Facebook, Mall of\nAmerica, Match.com, Monster.com, Sony, Skype, Google and others. Benefits to\neach group exhibit demand economies of scale. Consumers, for example, prefer\ncredit cards honored by more merchants, while merchants prefer cards carried by\nmore consumers. They are particularly useful for analyzing the chicken-and-egg\nproblem of standards battles, such as the competition between VHS and Beta. They\nare also useful in explaining many free pricing or \"freemium\" strategies where\none user group gets free use of the platform in order to attract the other user\ngroup. http://ssrn.com/abstract=249585 Geoffrey Parker and Marshall Van\nAlstyne (2000) ``Information Complements, Substitutes, and Strategic Product\nDesign'\" http://rje.org Bernard Caillaud and Bruno Jullien (2003).\n``Chicken & Egg: Competing Matchmakers.

Each network effect can\nbe either positive or negative. E.g. positive same-side network effect is end-\nuser PDF sharing or player-to-player contact in PlayStation 3 and negative same-\nside network effect appears when there is competition between suppliers in\nonline auction market or dates on Match.com. The concept of network effects were\nconceived independently by Geoffrey Parker & Van Alstyne\n([http://ssrn.com/abstract=249585 2000], [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1177443\n2005]) to explain behavior in software markets and Rochet & Tirole\n([http://www.dauphine.fr/cgemp/Publications/Articles/TirolePlatform.pdf 2001])\nto explain behavior in credit card markets.\n\nMulti-sided platforms exist because there is a need of intermediary in order to\nmatch both part of the platform in a more efficient way. Indeed this\nintermediary will minimize the overall cost for instance by avoiding duplication\nof by minimizing transaction costs. This intermediary will make possible\nexchange that would not occur without them and create value for both sides. Two-\nsided platforms, by playing an intermediary role, produce certain value for the\nboth users (parties) that are through it interconnected, and therefore those\nsides (parties) may both be evaluated as customers (unlike traditional seller-\nbuyer dichotomy).\n","linknr":192,"url":"Platform_(economics)","recorded":1362579026,"links":24,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/12-024.pdf","http://idei.fr/doc/wp/2005/2sided_markets.pdf","http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/12-024.pdf","http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/shapiro/wars.pdf","http://idei.fr/doc/wp/2005/2sided_markets.pdf"],"categories":["Markets (customer bases)"],"headings":["Structural characteristics","Competition in Two-Sided Networks","Pricing in Two-Sided Networks","Strategic issues","Multihoming","Winner take all","Threat of Envelopment","See also","Citations","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/2sidedmarketdiagram.svg/459px-2sidedmarketdiagram.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/2sidedmarketstandalone.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/53/2sidedmarketdeveloper.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/2sidedmarketconsumer.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["HMO","Economies_of_scale","Network_effect","Marshall_Van_Alstyne","Jean_Tirole","Network_effects","PDF","Software_development_kit","Videotape_format_war","High_definition_optical_disc_format_war","Switching_costs","Network_effect","Multihoming"]}
