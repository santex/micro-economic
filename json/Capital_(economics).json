{"cursor":"12018","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn economics, 'capital goods', or 'real capital' are already-produced durable\ngoods that are used in production of goods or services. The capital goods are\nnot significantly consumed, though they may depreciate in the production\nprocess. Capital is distinct from 'land' in that capital must itself be produced\nby human labor before it can be a factor of production. At any moment in time,\ntotal physical capital may be referred to as the 'capital stock' (which is not\nto be confused with the capital stock of a business entity.) In a fundamental\nsense, capital consists of any produced thing that can enhance a person's power\nto perform economically useful workâa stone or an arrow is capital for a caveman\nwho can use it as a hunting instrument, and roads are capital for inhabitants of\na city. Capital is an input in the production function. Homes and personal autos\nare not capital but are instead durable goods because they are not used in a\nproduction effort.\n\nIn Marxist political economy, capital is money used to buy something\nonly in order to sell it again to realize a financial profit, and for Marx\ncapital only exists within the process of economic exchangeâit is wealth that\ngrows out of the process of circulation itself and for Marx it formed the basis\nof the economic system of capitalism. This concept is also called financial\ncapital in economics.\n","linknr":399,"url":"Capital_(economics)","recorded":1362685722,"links":95,"instances":["economics","economics","economics","economics","economics","economics"],"pdf":["http://www.dse.unive.it/summerschool/course2007/accounting%20and%20rationality.pdf"],"categories":["Capital","Capitalism","Political economy","Economics terminology","Economics"],"headings":["In narrow and broad uses","Endowment","Interpretations","See also","Further reading","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["production","economics"],["good","economics"],["service","economics"],["land","economics"],["labour","economics"],["wealth","economics"]],"members":["land","good","production","wealth","service","labour"],"related":["Economics","Durable_good","Production_(economics)","Good_(economics)","Service_(economics)","Depreciation","Production_process","Factors_of_production","Stock","Production_function","Marxist","Wealth","Capitalism","Financial_capital","Classical_economics","Neoclassical_economics","Factors_of_production","Land_(economics)","Labour_(economics)","Intermediate_good","Depreciation","Paul_A._Samuelson","William_Nordhaus","Stock_and_flow","Stock_and_flow","Marxian_economics","Constant_capital","Variable_capital","Fictitious_capital","Paper_wealth","Human_capital","Knowledge_capital","Intellectual_capital","Human_development_theory","Social_capital","Individual_capital","Skill","Ingenuity","Leadership","Financial_capital","Public_capital","Natural_capital","Spiritual_capital","Natural_capital","Social_capital","Consensus","Intellectual_capital","Intellectual_property_law","Patent","Copyright","Individual_capital","Trademark","Social_capital","Werner_Sombart","Max_Weber","Double-entry_bookkeeping","Capitalism","Adam_Smith","Fixed_capital","Circulating_capital","Karl_Marx","David_Ricardo","Marxian","Surplus-value","Labor_theory_of_value","Constant_capital","Replacement_value","Investment","Capital_accumulation","Means_of_production","Saving","John_Maynard_Keynes","Austrian_School","Eugen_von_Boehm-Bawerk","Capital_intensity","Roundaboutness","Capital_deepening","Capital_accumulation","Capitalism","Capitalist_mode_of_production","Cambridge_capital_controversy","Constant_capital","Factors_of_production","Means_of_production","Organizational_capital","Organic_composition_of_capital","Physical_capital","The_Accumulation_of_Capital","Venture_capital","Variable_capital","Wealth_(economics)"]}
